                    <p> This project is a collaboration job between three CSE Students, 
                        a mechanical engineering student, and Dr. Turingan's Aqualab team. We will be
                        monitoring data that is collected with three different sensors and creating a 
                        web application to store and display the data in different forms. This system will
                        also alert the Aqualab team when measurements are out of the set range. </p>

                            communicating online. She is in charge of connecting the sensors  
                            to the software and recording the data.

                            She has created this page, as well as the website that will
                            be used by the Aqualab team.
